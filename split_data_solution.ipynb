    "### Overview\n",
    "By this point in the project, you should have already retrieved your images from Labelbox and stored them in a directory with their corresponding text files (you should change the constant `IMAGE_FOLDER` to be this). Before we can begin training our object detection model, we will want to split our labeled data into train, validation, and test sets. You will have some freedom on which ratio you use to split, but some commonly used ratios are:\n",
    "* 70% train, 15% valid, 15% test\n",
    "* 80% train, 10% valid, 10% test\n",
    "* 60% train, 20% valid, 20% test\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the general strategy we are going to use to split our data.\n",
    "1. For each set (train, valid, test) we will do the following:\n",
    "    * Make a directory to store the images (and text files) we assign to that set.\n",
    "    * Make a text file to keep track of all the image paths we assign to that set.\n",
    "2. Produce a list that contains all the text files in `IMAGE_FOLDER`. You will fill in the function called `get_text_files` to accomplish this.\n",
    "3. For each text file in that list, we will do the following:\n",
    "    * Find the image with the same base name (e.g. if we had puppy_1.txt, we might want puppy_1.jpg or puppy_1.png). You will fill in the function called `get_image_file` to accomplish this.\n",
    "    * Copy the text file and image to either the train, valid, or test directory (we will discuss the logic for this later in the notebook). Then, save the image path to either the train, valid, or test text file (same one as the directory you copied image and text file into). You will fill in the function called `assign_to_set` to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It may be helpful to check out *Step 4: Putting It All Together* before implementing individual function to see how the above strategy would translate to code."

    "### Logic for assigning data to train, valid, test\n",
    "In the `assign_to_set` function below, we are going to use some logic that involves the Modulo Operator (%) to split the data. As a reminder, the Modulo Operator returns the remainder of a quotient. Let's suppose, for example, that we simply wanted to evenly divide the contents of our `IMAGE_FOLDER` into two directories, A and B. Since we are evenly dividing the data between A and B, we want to randomly assign 50% of the images to A and the other 50% to B. This is where the Modulo Operator comes in! We could do something like this:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "if index % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    shutil.copy(text_path, 'A')\n",
    "    shutil.copy(image_path, 'A')\n",
    "    a.write(image_path + '\\n') # Here, a is the text file that saves the image paths for set A\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    shutil.copy(text_path, 'B')\n",
    "    shutil.copy(image_path, 'B')\n",
    "    b.write(image_path + '\\n') # Here, b is the text file that saves the image paths for set B\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "Now, using this logic, it's your turn to write the `assign_to_set` function. Keep in mind, you will have three sets (train, valid, test) and they should not be evenly split. So you will have to get creative with that Modulo Operator! Ultimately, you have control over which ratio you use to split as long as it is reasonable, but we recommend the following ratio: **80% train, 10% valid, 10% test.**"
